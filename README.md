# Files and File Systems Assignment

This assignment is made up of 3 sections:

1. MinMaxAvg
2. Expedition
3. Fantasy Football Stats

Each section is completely located in its own folder with in `src`, including an empty JS file for you to write your code in, a corresponding test file to automatically test your code, and any input files needed for the particular task.

## Manual Testing

You can manually test your code by creating dummy data to pass in as parameters and using console logs to check what is happening, as usual. While you could do this in the files you are writing the code in, a better idea would be to import your functions into the `index.js` file at the root of this project. This simulates how the tests are working and ensures that you are using the `__dirname` setup to make your reading and writing happen in the correct directories.

## Automated Testing

Because we are using the newer ES6 import/export syntax, the `Jest Test Explorer` extension won't work for us, so please disable or uninstall that one and instead install the `Jest` extension.
